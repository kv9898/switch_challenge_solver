# How to Use the Switch Challenge Solver

There are two ways of using the solver

1.  Drag and Click through the Graphical User Interface (GUI), which is potentially slower. This works only for the `GUI.py` or `GUI.exe`.

2.  Enter the full formula, which can be faster when you are more familiar as you have done more assessments (very bad humour). This works for both `GUI` and `command_line`.

If you have python on you computer, you can run the `GUI.py` or `command_line.py` directly. Note that you have to use this way if you are running on a MacOS or Linux machine, since I have only built executables for Windows.

If you are running on Windows and you are uncomfortable with running Python, you can use the `GUI.exe` or `command_line.exe` directly, after downloading from the [Release](https://github.com/kv9898/switch_challenge_solver/releases) page.

Please give me a starðŸŒŸ if you find this useful.

# Using Drag and Click through GUI

Similar to the problems, the GUI has two rows of "shapes", the row at the top is the inputs while the other one at the bottom is the outputs. There are two ways of rearranging them:

1.  Dragging: this will *swap* the two shapes.

2.  Clicking: this will move the clicked shape to the *end*. This allows for the order of your 4 clicks to be the final order of the four shapes.

For the easiest problems (as the one below), you just need to hit `enter`ï¼Œand the answer will be displayed below the line edit:

*PS: to clear the formula and answer, hit `Tab`*

For the harder question, you may need to enter the formula (from level 4 onward?) and hit `Enter`. In the formula, you need to replace the options with `x`ï¼š

The solver can handle x in any position:

For the hardest questions with two choices, you need to make a guess about the first choice, and let the solver find the second choice. If the answer is not correct, you need to try again. You may need to try 3 times at most:

In this case, the third option of the first choice is the correct answer. This implies that you need to try 3 times if you do from left to right.

# Using the full formula

The gist of the full formula is that you encode the outcome (number after `=`) in such a way that it is a single switch from the input to the output. In this case, ignore the shapes, they don't do anything. Note that you cannot use this method for the easiest problems (you solve it with your brain).

Let's use the hard case as an example:

As the shapes are now redundant, you may want to use the command line, which is more light-weight:
